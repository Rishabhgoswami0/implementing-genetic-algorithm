Genetic Optimization for Breast Cancer Classification  This project uses a genetic algorithm to select optimal features from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, improving the accuracy of Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and Gaussian Naive Bayes models for breast cancer diagnosis.
# Project Title: Enhancing Breast Cancer Classification through Genetic Algorithm-Driven Feature Selection

# Project Description:

This project explores the synergy between genetic algorithms and machine learning for enhancing breast cancer classification accuracy. By employing a genetic algorithm, the project aims to identify the most influential features from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset, thereby optimizing the performance of four distinct machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. The genetic algorithm simulates natural selection to evolve a population of feature subsets, iteratively refining the selection process to identify optimal combinations. This approach enables the models to focus on the most relevant data, potentially leading to increased accuracy, improved interpretability, and reduced computational cost. The project evaluates the impact of the genetic algorithm-based feature selection by comparing the performance of the models before and after optimization, demonstrating the potential of this technique for advancing breast cancer diagnosis.

# Uniqueness:

The integration of genetic algorithms with machine learning for feature selection is unique in this project. It is unusual for an independent project to utilize the genetic algorithm for this specific task. The use of four models for comparison, instead of the usual one, is also uncommon. I hope that this description helps to clarify and effectively showcase the novelty of your work.
